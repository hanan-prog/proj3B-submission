      <h1>Ray Tracer Project 3 Part B</h1>

      <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
      <p>
        Part B is essentially an extension of my code base from Part A. All of the rendering logic is implmented in Camera.h, I extended shading code to handle point, spot, and directional lights. I also added code to handle refraction as well as reflections.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can download the code here 
        <a href="p3.zip">here</a>. There's a
        Makefile to help with the compilation. To compile:
        <code>make clean && make</code> and to run
        <code>./raytracer 'filename'</code>
      </p>

      <h2>Difficulties/Issues Faced</h2>
      <p>
        Implementing spot light was so hard and adding refraction to my code was so hard. 
        I would get weird artificats on my sphere, rings within the sphere and there was a prominent black border around the green sphere.
      </p>

      <h2>Features Implemented</h2>
      <p>A list of features i was able to implement are listed below, I wasn't able to get the triangle rendering to work. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Arbitrary camera placement, film resolution, and aspect ratio</li>
            <li>Arbitrary scenes with spheres arbitrary background colors</li>
            <li>Arbitrary materials, including diffuse and specular shading, reflections, and refractions</li>
            <li>Point and directional lights</li>
            <li>Ambient lighting</li>
            <li>Shadows</li>
            <li>Recursion to a bounded depth</li>
        </ul>

            <p>Some images that showcase them working. The bear is my favorite, it was very cool and rewarding!</p>

            <p>The grey 'ground' sphere showing up on top of the image is a result of the way my camera basis vectors are calculated and I wasn't able to fix it. The grey ground sphere doesn't get reflected to the top of the second image.</p>

            <p>Spot lights were tough, it took a very long time to debug why the angle calculation were not working. This the best I could get it to work.</p>

            <p>Ambient lighting was the easiest to implement and worked right off the bat</p>
